## Tech Talk 2: Python Classes

- Organization: time box for each week, file directories, menu
- Code needs to run on replit and IntelliJ
- Object-oriented programming focuses on organizing and modifying data (flexible, abstracts complexity)
- Objects are variables (attributes) and functions (methods)
- init happens when class is called, object is made
- call is Python-exclusive, gives object ability to act as function
- First need to make object/instance, then use it as function and pass parameter. This will call method and return output
- See Users class example on nighthawkcoders wiki for example of complex class
- init gives ability to perform CRUD 
- class Users(db.Model): uses inheritance, object acts as library
