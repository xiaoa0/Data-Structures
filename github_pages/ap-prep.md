## Practice AP MC scores and corrections

### Quiz 1 (4/19): 47/50
- 23: Should be A. Cookies are used to track user activity, whereas public keys used in encryption are public so revealing them does not compromise security.
- 30: Should be A. Digital certificates are used to verify the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communication (certify website security).
- 38: Should be C. Having one phone number allows you to compile a list of other suspects based on who the criminal called.

Note: review Unit 5 content on Internet protocols, security, etc.

### Quiz 2 (4/21): 49/50
- 45: Should be A. Need to use "main" (more detailed) list combined with athlete database to compare GPAs of athletes and non-athletes. Using list 3 doesn't give overall view of GPAs and skews results.

### Reflection
Overall I scored very well on the MCs. The topics I need to review are Big Idea 5 (The Internet) and using databases to draw conclusions. My main concern is that while my timing was okay for the 50-question sets, I may end up dragging on the actual MC test because of the additional 20 questions. Another important issue is reviewing the examples provided by College Board for the Create Task and making sure my submission is up to standard. This will likely involve overhauling my code to meet the parameters requirement and changing complexity.

### Quiz 3 (4/26): 46/50
- 6: Should be C, because program is only looking for integers 1-20 and D uses "until x > 20", which will include 21.
- 11: Should be B, since age is a number. Don't know what happened here, may have skipped question or mistaken for #10 which was similar.
- 18: Should be C, because in that case program sees only one positive value and returns True when it should return false due to the previous negative values.
- 23: Shold be D, I thought A was a valid answer because I didn't count the decimal places (only saw messages hovering in middle 3 range). Characters per message has a more defined trend.

### Reflection
This score was still fairly good, but I need to review the College Board's pseudocode guide. I missed several questions due to my unfamiliarity with the syntax. Based on my previous quizzes, I also need to review the Internet and Data units. However, until 5/3 I mainly be focusing on polishing my Create Task.

### Quiz 5 (5/3): 25/25

### Reflection
I was able to finish the first 25 questions (as suggested) in half an hour, so I think my timing is good. I didn't miss any of the algorithm questions, so this means my pseudocode review paid off. This is also good because a large portion of the test (about 30%) is focused on algorithms. My plan is to time the Quiz 4 MC over the weekend to make sure I can keep the timing.
