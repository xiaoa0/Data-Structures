## Tech Talk 0: Python Menu, Replit, Github

- Can use "try" to manage errors
- Compare try/except menu to printed menu - much more organized, and easier to manage inputs. Don't need to write if statement for every entry
- Code: can use replit (online IDE), can connect to Github to track work/commits
