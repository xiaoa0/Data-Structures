## Tech Talk 1: Data Structures

* Collection is a data structure that holds more than one value (Ex: list)
* List is a class, has methods
* How to access methods? use "." (Ex: .append)
* Ex: infodb
* Initializing DB as empty list, appending dictionary to list
* Can access entries with 'get' or index value
* For loop: doesn't require counter
* While loop: requires counter
* Recursive loop: requires counter
* NOTE: need to use exit condition to make sure recursive loop eventually terminates
* Use tester for all backend code
